# psk31
Provides a python script to generate bpsk31 compatible binary input and a gnuradio flowgraph to transmit it.

The flowgraph was tested transmitting hackrf to an rtl-sdr dongle receiving via SDRSharp and vb-audio piping to MultiPSK.

Both SDRSharp and MultiPSK should be set to USB on the radio.
